## Date

- Edit by muhlenXi on 2019-10-09

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example: [➡️](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## My Solution

```swift
func maxDepth(_ root: TreeNode?) -> Int {
    guard let root = root else {
        return 0
    }
    
    let left = maxDepth(root.left)
    let right = maxDepth(root.right)
    
    return max(left, right) + 1
}
```
