## Description

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example：**

```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## Solution

`Swift`

```swift
func singleNumber(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
    var output = 0
    for element in nums {
        output = output ^ element
    }
    return output
}
```
