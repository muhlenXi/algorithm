# 922. Sort Array By Parity II

## Date

- Edit by muhlenXi on 2019-12-29.

## Description

Given an array AÂ of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Example:**

```
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```

**Note:**

- 1. 2 <= A.length <= 20000
- 2. A.length % 2 == 0
- 3. 0 <= A[i] <= 1000



## Solution

`Swift`

```swift
func sortArrayByParityII(_ A: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var output = Array(repeating: 0, count: A.count)
    var odd = 1
    var even = 0
    for element in A {
        if element % 2 == 0 {
            output[even] = element
            even += 2
        } else {
            output[odd] = element
            odd += 2
        }
    }
    return output
}

```
