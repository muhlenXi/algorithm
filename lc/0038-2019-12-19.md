# 38. Count and Say

### Date

- Edit by muhlenXi on 2019-12-19

## Description

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as "one 1" or 11.
`11` is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
`21` is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"

Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

### Thought

- 每一个数都是对上一个数的描述

### Solution

`Swift`

```swift
// 38
func countAndSay(_ n: Int) -> String {
    if n == 1 {
        return "1"
    }
    
    var output = "1"
    for _ in 1..<n {
        say(&output)
    }
    return output
}

func say(_ text: inout String){
    let pattern = text
    var counts = 0
    text = ""
    var repeatCharacter = pattern.first!
    for element in pattern {
        if element == repeatCharacter {
            counts += 1
        } else {
            text.append("\(counts)")
            text.append(repeatCharacter)
            repeatCharacter = element
            counts = 1
        }
    }
    
    text.append("\(counts)")
    text.append(repeatCharacter)
}
```
