# 520. Detect Capital


## Date

- Edit by muhlenXi on 2016-12-26.

## Description

Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

- 1、All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
- 2、All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
- 3、Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 

**Example**:

```
Input: "USA"
Output: True

Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
```

**Note**: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

## Solution

`Swift`

```
func detectCapitalUse(_ word: String) -> Bool {
    let uppercased = word.uppercased()
    let lowercased = word.lowercased()
    let capitalized = lowercased.capitalized
    
    switch word {
    case capitalized, uppercased, lowercased:
        return true
    default:
        return false
    }
}
```
