## Description

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Example: **

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```

**Note:**

- 
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

- 数组循环右移 k 位

## Solution


`Swift`

```swift
func rotate(_ nums: inout [Int], _ k: Int)  {
    guard nums.count > 1 else { return }
    guard k > 0 else { return }
    let kk = k % nums.count
    
    for _ in 0..<kk {
        let last = nums.removeLast()
        nums.insert(last, at: 0)
    }
}
```
