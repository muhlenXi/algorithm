## Description

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.


**Example:**

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Restrictions:**

- 1、The string consists of lower English letters only.
- 2、Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

### Solution

`Swift`

```
func reverseStr(_ s: String, _ k: Int) -> String {
    var maxCount = s.count / k
    if s.count % k != 0 {
        maxCount += 1
    }
    
    var ss = s.map { return $0 }
    var index = 0
    var flag = 0
    
    while index < ss.count {
        if flag % 2 == 0 {
            var low = index
            var high = min(index+k-1, ss.count-1)
            while low <= high {
                let temp = ss[low]
                ss[low] = ss[high]
                ss[high] = temp
                low += 1
                high -= 1
            }
        }
        index += k
        flag += 1
    }
    
    return String(ss)
}
```
