- Edit by muhlenXi on 2019-10-09.

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## My Solution

```swift
func minDepth(_ root: TreeNode?) -> Int {
    guard let root = root else {
        return 0
    }
    
    let left = minDepth(root.left)
    let right = minDepth(root.right)
    
    switch (left, right) {
    case (_, 0):
        return left + 1
    case (0, _):
        return right + 1
    default:
        return min(left, right) + 1
    }
}
```
