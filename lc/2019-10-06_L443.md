# 443. String Compression

## Description

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

## My Solution

```swift
// 443
func compress(_ chars: inout [Character]) -> Int {
    guard chars.count > 0 else {
        return 0
    }
    
    var character: Character = chars[0]
    var output = [Character]()
    var index = 1
    var repeats = 1
    
    while index < chars.count {
        if chars[index] == character {
            repeats += 1
            index += 1
        } else {
            reduce(chars: &output, c: character, repeats: repeats)
            
            character = chars[index]
            repeats = 1
            index += 1
        }
    }
    
    reduce(chars: &output, c: character, repeats: repeats)
    
    chars = output
    return output.count
}

func reduce(chars: inout [Character], c: Character, repeats: Int){
    chars.append(c)
    if repeats > 1 {
        let r: [Character] = "\(repeats)".map {$0}
        chars.append(contentsOf: r)
    }
}
```
